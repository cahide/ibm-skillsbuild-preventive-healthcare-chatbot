# 🩺 Preventive Healthcare Knowledge Builder

This project automatically collects **preventive healthcare** information from reliable medical sources such as  
**WHO, Mayo Clinic, CDC, HealthCare.gov, and HRSA**, then uses IBM **watsonx.ai** (Granite model)  
to generate **Question–Answer (Q&A)** pairs for chatbot training.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

1- Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/ibm-skillsbuild-preventive-healthcare-chatbot.git
cd ibm-skillsbuild-preventive-healthcare-chatbot

2- Add environment variables Using Google Colab Secrets with these names

api_key = userdata.get('WATSONX_API_KEY')
project_id = userdata.get('WATSONX_PROJECT_ID')

🧠 How It Works

The script reads URLs from scrape_url.json

It scrapes paragraph text from each page

Only paragraphs containing key health terms (like exercise, diet, nutrition, disease, prevention, and well-being) are kept.

Each paragraph is sent to the Granite model to generate 3-5 diverse Q&A pairs.

All results are saved in preventive_health_faq.json.
